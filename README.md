# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# SOEN-341-Project

## Description

A versatile communication platform for seamless interaction through text channels and direct messaging, _SkiGo_ allows skiers and snowboarders to connect in a virtual community or chatting privately. The platform offers an intuitive and organized space to plan carpooling to ski and snowboarding destinations, often outside the reach of public transit. Users can create topic-specific channels, share media, and engage in one-on-one conversations, all while enjoying customizable features that enhance the experience. With a clean interface and robust privacy options, the platform is the perfect hub for efficient communication.

## Objective

The objective is for users without access to a motor vehicle to carpool to a ski and snowboarding destination with a user who does have access to a motor vehicle. The driver would pick up a pre-determined number of users at agreed-upon points along the route to a pre-determined destination. A third-party website would be used for the driver to receive compensation to offset the mileage cost.   

## Core Features

**Text Channels for Group Communication**
- Users can join a set of channels (e.g., "Jay Peak," "Mont Tremblant," "Sommet Saint-Sauveur").
- Messages sent in a channel are visible to all users in that channel.
  
**Direct Messaging Between Users**
- Users can chat privately.

**Role-Based User Permissions**
- Two roles: Admin and Member.
- Admins can create/delete channels and moderate messages (delete inappropriate ones).
- Members can only send and view messages.
