# SOEN-341-Project

## Description

A versatile communication platform for seamless interaction through text channels and direct messaging, _SkiGo_ allows skiers and snowboarders to connect in a virtual community or chatting privately. The platform offers an intuitive and organized space to plan carpooling to ski and snowboarding destinations, often outside the reach of public transit. Users can create topic-specific channels, share media, and engage in one-on-one conversations, all while enjoying customizable features that enhance the experience. With a clean interface and robust privacy options, the platform is the perfect hub for efficient communication.

## Objective

The objective is for users without access to a motor vehicle to carpool to a ski and snowboarding destination with a user who does have access to a motor vehicle. The driver would pick up a pre-determined number of users at agreed-upon points along the route to a pre-determined destination. A third-party website would be used for the driver to receive compensation to offset the mileage cost.   

## Core Features

**Text Channels for Group Communication**
- Users can join a set of channels (e.g., "Jay Peak," "Mont Tremblant," "Sommet Saint-Sauveur").
- Messages sent in a channel are visible to all users in that channel.
  
**Direct Messaging Between Users**
- Users can chat privately.

**Role-Based User Permissions**
- Two roles: Admin and Member.
- Admins can create/delete channels and moderate messages (delete inappropriate ones).
- Members can only send and view messages.
